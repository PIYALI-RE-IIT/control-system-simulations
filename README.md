### About the Experiment 
**System**
				
A system, an abstract entity, receives inputs and generates outputs in return. It's often termed as a plant or process. The field of control systems deals with applying or choosing the inputs to a given system to achieve a desired output. The automatic control or feedback control has become an integral part of modern manufacturing and industrial processes. When multiple elements or components are linked sequentially to execute a specific task, they form a system. If the output is regulated by adjusting the input, it's termed as a control system. The output is the controlled variable or response, while the input is the command signal or excitation.

In this experiment, the behaviour of some control systems will be analysed and simulation of their responses will be observed. With the help of problem statement, the behaviour of a unity feedback system, Nyquist plot, Bode plot, root locus and system response of a permanent magnet dc motor will be discussed.
