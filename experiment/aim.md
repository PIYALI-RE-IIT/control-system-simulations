### Aim of the experiment

To simulate some control systems and study their behaviour.
				 
1. To plot the response of a unity feedback system for different values of damping ratio (&zeta;) and also plot its rise time (<span class="fontCss3">t<sub>r</sub></span>), settling time (<span class="fontCss3">t<sub>s</sub></span>), &prcent; maximum overshoot when the inputs applied to the system are the unit step and unit impulse.

2. To plot the root locus diagram of a given unity feedback system and plot the output response of the system for different values of amplifier gain (<span class="fontCss">K</span>). 

3. To check the stability of a given unity feedback system by drawing Bode and Nyquist diagrams and hence indicate the gain margin, phase margin, gain cross over frequency, phase cross over frequency.

4. To study the system response of a permanent magnet dc motor.
